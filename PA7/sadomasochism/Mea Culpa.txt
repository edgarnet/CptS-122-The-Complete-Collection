Hello Master,

I just wanted to give you a heads up as to why I turned this assignment in four days after the due date. 
I am not asking for an extension for the next assignment, which I plan to finish on time.

In this assignment, we were asked to allocate attendance information for students from a given .csv file in "realtime". 
The suggested method for collecting our system's time was via the time_t data type and the corresponding struct tm. 
What was not made evident to me was that the function used to store time_t into a stuct tm, known as localtime(), 
returns a STATIC pointer. As it very well implies, each call of localtime() manipulated every struct tm during runtime. 
If I would've known this condition beforehand, I wouldn't be writing this email. 
To mitigate this dilemma, every execution of the program is treated as a "new day", where local copies of struct tm's iterate and interact 
with each other to simulate a 'dynamic' flow of time. I could only image a lunatic assigning this PA for another lunatic to lose their sanity 
in modeling discrete changes in time.

Sorry I couldn't finish this sooner,

- Edgar

P.S. If you want to test the validity of this simulation, I recommend deleting the contents of "Master.txt".
